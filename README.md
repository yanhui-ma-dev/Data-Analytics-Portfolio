🚀 Data Analytics & Machine Learning Portfolio (R)

📌 Project Overview
This repository showcases an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning workflow, bridging the gap between complex data orchestration and actionable business intelligence. It focuses on delivering evidence-based clarity for strategic decision-making.

📂 Key Business Modules
1. Retail Analysis: Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction
Core Achievement: Translated 500k+ transactional records into a strategic RFM framework and developed a Churn Prediction Model achieving 90.5% accuracy.

Business Value: Identifies high-value segments and detects at-risk customers to drive targeted retention growth.

Interactive Visualization: Developed executive-level Tableau dashboards to provide a "Source of Truth" for customer health metrics.

2. Big Data Pipeline: Scalable Data Orchestration
Core Achievement: Orchestrated a high-performance pipeline to facilitate data linkage of 21.8M+ spatiotemporal records.
